# Nodepop - Advanced Backend

This project is an advanced version of the Nodepop backend built during the Full Stack Bootcamp. It extends the fundamentals with real-world backend features for a marketplace app.

## Features

- User login and session handling
- Users can create products with:
  - Name, price, image, tags
  - Ownership linking (user â†’ product)
- File upload with Multer (avatars and product images)
- Internationalization (i18n) with cookie-based language selection
- Static files served for uploaded images
- REST API with full CRUD for products and users
- API documentation using Swagger UI
